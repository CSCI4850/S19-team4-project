    "This network \"turned out\" the best, although the network itself really didn't do that well; I just got lucky. I went from getting about 39% pretty consistently to suddently getting 70%! I was so amazed that I double checked myself and ran the \"evaluate\" function again at the end just to prove it. That said, I later ran the exact same network with the only difference being a smaller validation_split and I added 10 to x_test and y_test. The output of that was 41%... so back to the mean. This was more or less what I expected, however.\n",
