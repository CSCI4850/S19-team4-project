    "This project came about from Dr. Philips' 2019 Neural Networks class held at Middle Tennessee State University. Groups were formed based on ideas for training a neural network. Our group chose to use fMRI data to teach a neural net to detect schizophrenia. The FMRI data we chose had the patient in a restful state. Our end goal was for the net to be able to dectect whether or not a patient had schizophrenia based on a fMRI scan. We would attempt to attain an accuracy above 75%."
